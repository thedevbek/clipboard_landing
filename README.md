### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I still struggle with the application of making everything responsive. I am able to get it, but even using Tailwind  CSS it takes me a while when I am working with sm, md, and large screens. Practice is the only I will get good at this. 


### Continued development

I am going to do another Frontend Mentor and focus on Tailwind CSS and resposiveness. 

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me for my CSS, I really like it because it is faster than CSS. Even though I had trouble with responsiveness in the project, I would have had an even harder time with Vanilla CSS.
